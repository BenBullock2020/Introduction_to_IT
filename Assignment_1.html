			<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
			<div>
				<p>My interest in IT first began when I decided to build my own personal computer. I remember that my parents didn't want me to have a computer because they thought it would distract me from my studies. I had to convince them that it was a learning experience to build my own personal computer, and demonstrate that I did my research into building computers and how to protect myself and the computer parts that I was putting together.</p>
				<p>I've been thinking for a while that I need to expand my horizons for job options for the future. I had heard from friends and family that have completed the bachelor of IT course at RMIT university that they had thoroughly enjoyed it. So I decided to follow-up my passion for IT and start the Bachelor of IT myself</p>
				<p>I expect to learn how to work effectively and efficently independently and as a team. I hope to experience an environment that will help engage my learning abilities and help cultivate my passion for IT, with new ideas and opinions that will make me a stronger member of the IT industry</p>

Visualizing network users and defining them throughout the network. Understanding of Local and Wireless Access network and the use of networking and security tools</p>
				<p>The qualifications required for this position are a Bachelors of IT or Computer Science or any relevant industry certificates</p>
				<p>This position requires at least one year of experience supporting Microsoft applications within a commerical industry.</p>
				<p>Working in Retail and Fast Food I've developed skills that are focused on customer service and working through problems logically where we come to a solution that is beneficial to both parties.</p>
				<p>I'm currently completing a Bachelors' of Information and Technology at RMIT. I plan to use this degree and my experience in customer service, to get a IT related job that focuses on supporting commercial businesses, such as IT Help Desk. I can then use the experiences and skill I learn from this, to get a Junior ICT infrastructure Support Analyst position </p>

				<p>The main take away I get from these tests are that I am mostly an independent learner that relies on an auditory learning style. From my creativity test, I can see that I mostly strive in complexity and curiosity. Which means that I would be able to find common elements or relationships between information and then develop solutions that would be helpful for everyone.</p>
				<p>My results from these tests will influence my behaviour in a team because it outlines what I will need to work on while working in a team. While I am quiet introverted and rely on listening to learn, I will need to get out of my comfort zone and voice my opinions and ask for help if I am struggling or confused with what I am doing</p>
				<p>When forming a team, I believe the most important thing is communication. From the results, I am very good at listening and I'm pretty open to new ideas and I can adapt my own opinion base on logical reasoning. This is important when forming a team because everyone comes from different backrounds and have different solutions to problems. Working out a solution that is fair and interesting to everyone is going to be the main focus when forming a group and ensure that everyone will participate.</p>

			<h2>Project Idea</h2>
			<div>
				<p>The project that I have decided to do is to develop a guitar music learning application on a mobile phone. This application would be focused on beginner learners of guitar that may not have a great understanding of rhythm or music theory but still are keen to learn a new instrument. It would include some basic music theory and chord shapes, but the bulk of the application would be little minigames that will include rhythm techniques and music theory that has been learned, and would assist the playing to retain that information better through playing the interactive minigames. </p>
				<p>My motivation for making this application is that I love playing and learning guitar so making an application that will help me as well as newer guitar players sounds like an awesome and fun thing to do. I subscribe to the idea that an interactive learning experience makes learning new instruments as well as providing motivation to learn new skill makes it much easier to progress. Furthermore, music theory can be very difficult to pick up so designing an app that brings playing the actual guitar to the foreground while still having elements of learning musical theory can really motivate people to progress further than what they normally would trying without the app. </p>
				<p>The bulk of this application will be the minigames to help the user learn some cool techniques and theory that they will be able to show off to their friends. The main minigame will be a game that will represent each of the 6 strings as a colour and then have a coloured large circle with a number next to it that will represent what string to hit and which fret the note is on the guitar. This circle will move towards a bar on the screen which will represent when the user will need to play that note to make it sound rhythmically and musically good. The user will be able to adjust the speed of the notes so that they can get used to the positioning of their fingers without it being brutally hard for a newer user. A secondary minigame will be similar in how it is played and shown on the screen but will focus more on playing chords on the guitar, which will assist guitar players in mastering chords on the guitar. I believe it is important to separate singular notes and chords like this into separate games because it will be easier for a new player to decide what kind of guitar player they enjoy being, whether they like busting out those made riffs or keeping the songs rhythmically or musically interesting by playing chords. If a user is looking to be challenged, a challenging mode will be added that will combine the two game modes and allow the users to play both chords and be able to play riffs in the one game mode. 
				In addition to this, minigames that will help with rhythm techniques will be implemented. A game that will play a rhythmic phrase that will need to be mimicked by the user or else they lose a life and if the user loses three lives then it is game over. Since this game will focus on rhythm it wonâ€™t matter as much if the user hits a particular note just whether they actually rhythmically accurate so even a option to not have a guitar and just tap on the screen will be suitable for this part of the application. 
				Finally, the application will also serve as a learning tool for users who are wishing to learn more about guitar theory. A section on the application will focus on the users learning new chords, notes, and new guitar techniques that they will be able to use in the minigames. In addition to this, this part of the application will also allow the user to record their own little riffs that they make themselves which can be implemented in the minigames if they wish to replay them or have other people try out the riffs or songs  that they have made. </p>
				<p>I am thinking of using software such as game maker studio 2 or MIT App Inventor to make the actual application. In terms of hardware, I would need a phone or a computer to test the application. In addition to this, I would need a guitar to make sure the application serves its function of being a fun and interactive way to learn guitar. To make the graphical user interface and animations an application such as Adobe After Effects would be a powerful tool to make it stand out and look good. In addition to this, I would have to record some music for guitar and then transpose it into the actual application. </p>
				<p>In terms of skills for this project a development team would have to be varied. Programming skills would be essential to make the software. If Game maker studio 2 is used, then the programming language is Game Maker Language which is a scripting language like C or Java. To design the graphical user interface and animations for the minigames, a development team would need someone that is comfortable in using tools like Adobe After Effects. Furthermore, you would need a few different users to test the application with varying experience playing guitar and using mobile applications. In terms of feasibility, I think this application performs reasonability well. The hardest thing about creating this application would be experience programming and using tools like After Effects. To acquire these skills these days is as simple as finding the motivation to look up online tutorials and time just playing around with the programming language or After Effects. In addition to this, finding people with varying abilities in playing guitar and using applications might be difficult leading to a smaller amount of feedback for the development team to improve the app. Finally, if I decided to use commercial music in the application then I would have to acquire licences to the songs through their agents. Making all the music original to the app would solve that problem but would add time to the development of the application. </p>
				<p>The outcome of this mobile application is a portable way to learn and improve your skills for guitar in a fun and interactive way, while learning some musical theory along the way. The main impact of this application is for people to understand that you can still learn awesome riffs and techniques without being bogged down in music theory that a user might not understand straight away.</p>
