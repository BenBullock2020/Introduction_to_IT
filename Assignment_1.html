			<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
			<div>
				<p>My interest in IT first began when I decided to build my own personal computer. I remember that my parents didn't want me to have a computer because they thought it would distract me from my studies. I had to convince them that it was a learning experience to build my own personal computer, and demonstrate that I did my research into building computers and how to protect myself and the computer parts that I was putting together.</p>
				<p>I've been thinking for a while that I need to expand my horizons for job options for the future. I had heard from friends and family that have completed the bachelor of IT course at RMIT university that they had thoroughly enjoyed it. So I decided to follow-up my passion for IT and start the Bachelor of IT myself</p>
				<p>I expect to learn how to work effectively and efficently independently and as a team. I hope to experience an environment that will help engage my learning abilities and help cultivate my passion for IT, with new ideas and opinions that will make me a stronger member of the IT industry</p>
