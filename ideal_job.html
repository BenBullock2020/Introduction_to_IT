				<p>My understanding of a ICT Infratructure Support Analyst, is that they would use their skills to manage the maintenance and implementation of networking solutions. The main thing that interests me for this particular role, is that it will give me hands on experience working with and maintaining a range of different network solutions</p>
				<p>The skills required for this position would be updating and maintaining networks through virtualisation, which is using software to create servers and network solutions. Visualizing network users and defining them throughout the network. Understanding of Local and Wireless Access network and the use of networking and security tools</p>
				<p>The qualifications required for this position are a Bachelors of IT or Computer Science or any relevant industry certificates</p>
				<p>This position requires at least one year of experience supporting Microsoft applications within a commerical industry.</p>
				<p>Working in Retail and Fast Food I've developed skills that are focused on customer service and working through problems logically where we come to a solution that is beneficial to both parties.</p>
				<p>I'm currently completing a Bachelors' of Information and Technology at RMIT. I plan to use this degree and my experience in customer service, to get a IT related job that focuses on supporting commercial businesses, such as IT Help Desk. I can then use the experiences and skill I learn from this, to get a Junior ICT infrastructure Support Analyst position </p>
