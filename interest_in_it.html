				<p>My interest in IT first began when I decided to build my own personal computer. I remember that my parents didn't want me to have a computer because they thought it would distract me from my studies. I had to convince them that it was a learning experience to build my own personal computer, and demonstrate that I did my research into building computers and how to protect myself and the computer parts that I was putting together.</p>
				<p>I've been thinking for a while that I need to expand my horizons for job options for the future. I had heard from friends and family that have completed the bachelor of IT course at RMIT university that they had thoroughly enjoyed it. So I decided to follow-up my passion for IT and start the Bachelor of IT myself.</p>
				<p>I expect to learn how to work effectively and efficently independently and as a team. I hope to experience an environment that will help engage my learning abilities and help cultivate my passion for IT, with new ideas and opinions that will make me a stronger member of the IT industry. In addition to this, I would like to develop the skills needed to get a job in the ever changing and expanding IT industry</p>
				<p>My experiences in IT in a commercial environment are pretty limited unfortunately, I just did two weeks at Monash University (now Federation University) in Churchill when I was in year 10. I ghosted one of the network specialists for the two weeks and they just explained how they did their job and how it helped Monash Univerity achieve their networking and Information Technology goals. I did enjoy it and I learned a bit about how a network operates for a university and how a Help Desk position can support a business when they have IT issues</p>
