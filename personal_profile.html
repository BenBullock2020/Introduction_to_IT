				<p>The main take away I get from these tests are that I am mostly an independent learner that relies on an auditory learning style. From my creativity test, I can see that I mostly strive in complexity and curiosity. Which means that I would be able to find common elements or relationships between information and then develop solutions that would be helpful for everyone.</p>
				<p>My results from these tests will influence my behaviour in a team because it outlines what I will need to work on while working in a team. While I am quiet introverted and rely on listening to learn, I will need to get out of my comfort zone and voice my opinions and ask for help if I am struggling or confused with what I am doing</p>
				<p>When forming a team, I believe the most important thing is communication. From the results, I am very good at listening and I'm pretty open to new ideas and I can adapt my own opinion base on logical reasoning. This is important when forming a team because everyone comes from different backrounds and have different solutions to problems. Working out a solution that is fair and interesting to everyone is going to be the main focus when forming a group and ensure that everyone will participate.</p>
