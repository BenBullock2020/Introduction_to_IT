				<h3>Interpretation of Results</h3>
				<p>My results from the 16 personality test shows that i'm a mediator. Though I take this personality test with a grain of salt, my interpretation of a mediator is someone that seems quiet reserved but can see the positives in many different ideas and can work with people to come to a conclusion that will benefit all parties instead of benefiting just a singular individual, which I think suits my interpretation of my own personality. After I completed the learning style test, I wasn't suprised to find out that I am more of an auditory learner and visual learner. This being said, I don't think I really agree with any of the dot points except for reading things out a loud if I don't understand it the first time. Maybe I should give them a try one day. Which means that I would be able to find common elements or relationships between information and then develop solutions that would be helpful for everyone. From my creativity test, I can see that I mostly strive in complexity, curiosity and abstraction. From what I understand of the creativity test, these traits mean that I can seek out things that I think are a problem, gather lots of information about the situation and develop a solution that I would like to become the norm. While I agree with this statement to some extent, I would say that I typically don't seek out issues to solve but if they are brought to my attention that I will definitely solve the issue with this methodology</p>
				<p>My results from these tests will influence my behaviour in a team because it outlines what I will need to work on while working in a team. While I am quiet introverted and rely on listening to learn, I will need to get out of my comfort zone and voice my opinions and ask for help if I am struggling or confused with what I am doing. Furthermore, learning to take the iniative would definitely help solve issues before they escalate and become worse problems then what they need to be.</p>
				<p>When forming a team, I believe the most important thing is communication. From the results, I am very good at listening and I'm pretty open to new ideas and I can adapt my own opinion base on logical reasoning. This is important when forming a team because everyone comes from different backrounds and have different solutions to problems. Working out a solution that is fair and interesting to everyone is going to be the main focus when forming a group and ensure that everyone will participate.</p>
